        "# Expectation Maximization\n",
        "\n",
        "The *Expectation Maximization (E-M) Algorithm* is an iterative approach to finding maximum likelihood estimates for latent variables (since the likelihoods we want to maximize are only indirectly available). It is comprised of an estimation step, which tries to estimate the unknown variables, and a maximization step, which then tries to optimize the parameters of the model to better explain the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The unknown parameters are sometimes written as $\\phi$ or $\\Theta$, and we can call the latent, \"nuisance,\" variables $J$, and the observed data $U$. So, from above, the process can be roughly seen as \n",
        "$$ \\Theta^* = \\operatorname*{argmax}_{\\Theta} \\sum_{J\\in\\mathcal{J}^n} P(\\Theta, J|U) $$ \n",
        "Since this shows us maximizing the posterior probability of parameters $\\Theta$ given our data and we are summing over $J$ in order to marginalize out our latent variables (Dellaert, 2002).\n",
        "\n",
        "This process was first rigorously defined on the exponential family, where the probability density functions take the form \n",
        "$$ f(x|\\phi) = b(x)\\exp(\\phi t(x)^T/a(\\phi))$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $\\phi$ is a $1\\times r$ parameter vector and $t(x)$ is a $1\\times r$ vector of sufficient statistics for the data. Our \"natural parameter\" for these exponential distributions is given by some $r\\times r$ linear transformation. \n",
        "\n",
        "To run the \\textbf{E-M} algorithm on this example, we first enter the expectation step, and take $t^{(p)}=E[t(x)|y,\\phi^{(p)}]$  with the $(p)$ denoting the $p^{th}$ cycle of the algorithm, trying to estimate the vector of sufficient statistics for the exponential distribution. \n",
        "\n",
        "The maximization step, is then taking the equation $E[t(x)|y,\\phi^{(p)}]=t^{(p)}$ and we call the solution to this equation $\\phi^{(p+1)}$. We then plug in $\\phi^{(p+1)}$ to the expectation step and keep iterating (Dempster *et al.* 1976). \n",
        "\n",
        "One of the coolest parts of this algorithm is that it actually converges to a local maximum almost every time (Dempster *et al.* 1976). Dempster, Laird, and Rubin may have been slighly optimistic about how often E-M converged, due to a misuse of the triangle inequality, but C.F. Jeff Wu found and corrected that mistake, and came out with a more concrete understanding of when the algorithm converges, and to what it converges (Wu, 1983). While the algorithm may not converge to a local maximum every time, the likelihood that the parameters the algorithm optimizes each step are better estimates increases after each cycle of the algorithm. And thus, for some E-M sequence $\\phi_p$, if $L(\\phi_p)$ is bounded above, then E-M converges to some $L^*$.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Dempster, Laird, and Rubin's seminal paper *Maximum Likelihood via the 'EM' Algorithm*, they enumerate the process detailed above, proved the convergence, and later on, proposed that E-M could be used to in *finite clusters*. This foreshadowed the most common usage of the algorithm, clustering, or more specifically, dividing unlabeled data into nice clusters. For example, if we know that our raw data is comprised of unique groups represented by different probability distributions, we can use the E-M algorithm to systematically change the parameters for the estimated distributions of these groups to maximize the probability that the data belongs to the proposed clustering.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Gaussian Mixture Modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most common usages of expectation maximization, and specifically clustering, is *Gaussian Mixture Modeling* (GMM) (Hasselblad 1966). This process is essentially assuming that each group you are trying to sort out is represented by a multivariate normal distribution. This is often a very convenient technique to use because things often actually do follow normal distributions because of the central limit theorem and because once we have clusters that are normal, it is much easier to do inference on the clusters. In industry and other settings where statisticians have to communicate their results to non-statisticians it is also helpful to be able to talk about results in the context of normal distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "GMMs are used to observe clusters everywhere. They are used to create customer archetypes in retail, to better understand the different ways people shop, they are used in medical scenarios in order to identify types of tumors for cancer detection.\n",

Both of the metrics are based on the likelihood function for the mixture models and the main difference between them is that BIC punishes models with more parameters more than AIC, as we can see from the plot, since the BIC is minimized at right around 4 clusters and AIC continues to decrease as the number of components reaches 15.
